# Colour Identification in Images
Colour Identification is the process of detecting the name of any colour.
In this colour detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which you can get the name of the colour by clicking on them. 
So for this, we will have a data file that contains the colour name and its values. 
Then we will calculate the distance from each colour and find the shortest one.
